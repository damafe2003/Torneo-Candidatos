# Torneo-Candidatos
Simulacion del torneo de candidatos/Candidates Tournament simulation

This is a code in Python that simulates the Chess Candidates Tournament 2020,  with a little tiebreak in case of draw. 
If after the tiebreak they are tied, the point is shared. 

I know that the tiebreaks in the tournament are in order: 1) head-to-head score among tied players, 2) total number of wins, 3) Sonneborn–Berger score (SB), 4) tie-break games.

But I wanted to simplify it :)
